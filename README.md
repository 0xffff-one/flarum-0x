Customized [flarum](https://github.com/flarum/flarum) for the [0xFFFF Community](https://0xffff.one/).

## Customizations
The customizations of Flarum 0x consists of these parts:
1. Initialized [Flarum Skeleton](https://github.com/flarum/flarum) with our custom `composer.json` / `composer.lock` config (contains the extensions we are using)
2. Patches for the extensions in `vendor/` to make some small changes without publishing new Composer Packages
3. Custom [flarum extenders](https://docs.flarum.org/extend/start#extenders) in `extend.php`
4. *(To Be Done)* Custom third-party extension integrated in this repo as submodules

## Setup Local Development Env
