## 0xFFFF Flarum
Customized flarum for the [0xFFFF](https://0xffff.one/) website, with our LNMP Dev Container config.

## Customizations
The customizations of 0xFFFF's flarum application consists of these parts:
1. Initialized [Flarum Skeleton](https://github.com/flarum/flarum) with our custom `composer.json` and `composer.lock` config
2. Custom [flarum extenders](https://docs.flarum.org/extend/start#extenders) in `extend.php`
3. Patches for the extensions in `vendor/` to make some small changes without publishing new Composer Packages
4. *(To Be Done)* Custom [flarum framework](https://github.com/flarum/framework) and third-party extension integrated in this repo as submodules
